            <p class="t1">   For the fig - swirl : Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan . Add brown sugar and stir to dissolve . Halve all of the figs and toss in the saucepan with water and lemon juice . Cook over medium heat , stirring frequently , until you have a chunky - jammy mixture . Add salt with one or two stirs , set aside and let cool completely . </p> <br>
            <p class="t1">   Ice cream : In a small pot over medium heat , combine milk , and granulated sugar until sugar is completely dissolved and the milk is just barely lukewarm . Whisk in the egg yolks . Set mixture in the fridge and wait until the fig mixture is cooled .</p> <br>
            <p class="t1">   Using an ice cream machine , pour liquids into the frozen basin and process according to manufacturer instructions , i.e. , let spin and thicken for 20 minutes before adding mascarpone , fig jam mixture , and the nuts . Continue to process for +/- 10 minutes . Pour semi - frozen mixture into a pyrex dish or glass tupperware . Freeze for at least two hours before serving .</p> <br>
